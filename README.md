Do you have a large dataset, and you need to be able to display it in a dropdown?

When a basic select input is not enough, you can use a combobox!

A combobox works like a select input, but instead of a dropdown, it displays a list of options that can be filtered by typing.

You will no longer need to download all the data at the startup, just get the data you're looking for.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require sertxudeveloper/livewire-combobox
```

Finally, you can start using the package!
